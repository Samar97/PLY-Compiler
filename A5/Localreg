Maintain a register list.
Each temporary is used only once on the RHS or for storing result of a comparison
Once the temporary occurs in the RHS or it occurs in a comparison statement like bne x,0 label, mark the register associated with that variable as free
Allocate registers to new temporaries from the free list

Order the local variables in sorted order

Stack grows downwards

In a function call, the order of parameters is the order of passing
f(e,a,d)
d a e
